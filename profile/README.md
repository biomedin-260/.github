## Instructors üçé
- [Dr. Mirabela Rusu, PhD](https://profiles.stanford.edu/mirabela-rusu) is an Assistant Professor, in the Department of Radiology, and, by courtesy, Department of Urology and Biomedical Data Science, at Stanford University, where she leads the Personalized Integrative Medicine Laboratory (PIMed). The PIMed Laboratory has a multi-disciplinary direction and focuses on developing analytic methods for biomedical data integration, with a particular interest in radiology-pathology fusion to facilitate radiology image labeling. The radiology-pathology fusion allows the creation of detailed spatial labels, that later on can be used as input for advanced machine learning, such as deep learning. The recent focus of the lab has been on applying deep learning methods to detect and differentiate aggressive from indolent prostate cancers on MRI using the pathology information (both labels and the image content), work that was recently published in Medical Physics and Medical Image Analysis Journals. Moreover, our project are interested in further develop these approaches for ultrasound images.
